The future belongs to generalists. While AI tools can now write code, design interfaces, and analyze data, they struggle to connect dots across disciplines. That's where generalists thrive.

## The Specialist Trap

Specialization made sense when knowledge was scarce. But in 2025, AI can generate boilerplate, debug common issues, and follow established patterns. The specialist who only knows React or only designs UIs is competing with tools that do their job faster and cheaper.

## The Generalist Advantage

Generalists see systems, not silos. When building ARK Adventures, I didn't just code—I understood user psychology, business economics, and physical experience design. That cross-domain thinking is what creates breakthrough products.

## What This Means

By 2030, the premium will shift from "knowing React" to "understanding how React fits into a product strategy that serves humans." Generalists who can architect experiences, not just implement features, will command the highest value.

The question isn't whether you're a specialist or generalist. It's whether you can think beyond your domain and build for humans, not just metrics.
